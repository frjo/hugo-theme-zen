# The Hugo Zen theme

**Zen** theme strives to be as clean and standard compliant as possible with some neat features. A solid base for your custom [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme.

It uses HTML5 with a modern CSS grid and flex layout. Care has been taken to produce semantic and accessible code.

## Demo site

Take a look at the [Zen demo site](https://zen-demo.xdeb.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/frjo/zen-demo)).

## Quickstart

Quickstart a new site with the Zen theme by using the [Zen demo repo as a template](https://github.com/frjo/zen-demo/generate).

## Version 3.x

* Implement modern CSS like flex, grid and variables throughout.
* All sass variables now have a css variable version. All styles use the css variable version.
* Defaults to a System-ui font stack (like GitHub and Stack overflow among others).
* New setting `params.internalPagination` to use the Hugo built in pagination template instead of the plain Zen version.
* New setting `params.sassTranspiler`. Defaults to "libsass" but "dartsass" is also supported.
* Split sass "reset" dir into "base" dir and pure "reset" file.
* Added margin top/bottom/block classes, mt--m/mb--m/mtb--m, for all "spacing" variables.
* New sass components:
    * cards
    * center
    * disabled
    * flex-group
    * flex-inline
    * footer
    * grid-group
    * grid-stack
    * icon-inline
    * meta
    * spacing
    * stretch
    * tags
* Remove all use of "typey" lib.
* Remove unused/outdated components.
* Only a few small changes to templates.


### Upgrade to 3.x

1. Update your projects `_colors.scss` to add the new colours.
2. Update overridden variables in projects `_extra.scss` so they match changes in themes `_variables.scss`.
3. Replace `@include font-size(s);` with `font-size: var(--fs-s);` etc.
4. Replace `@include typeface(headings);` with `font-family: var(--ff-headings);` etc.
5. Replace sass variables with css variables, e.g. `$zen-gutters` with `var(--gutters)`.


## Version 2.x

* Replaced "normalize" with slimmer and updated "reset". Removed everything for old IE versions.
* Use of css4 variables. Colours are now used like this `var(--color-brand)`.
* The colors, fonts and variables sass files are now in the root sass directory.
* Use `site` instead of `.Site` and `$.Site`.
* Use a default line-height of unitless 1.5. For headers it is set to 1.3.
* Added `_extra.scss` where variables can be overridden.
* The zen-gutters variable is now a calculated value based on window width.

## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo Extended version 0.88.1 or higher is required.


## Installation

### Hugo module

First of all, you need to turn your new or existing site into a hugo module.

From the root of your site:

```shell
hugo mod init github.com/me/my-site
```

Afterwards, declare the `zen` theme module as a dependency of your site:

From the root of your site:

```shell
hugo mod get -u github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen/v3
```

### Git submodule

You can download and unpack the theme manually from Github but it's easier to use git to clone the repo.

From the root of your site:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen.git themes/zen
```

If you use git to version control your site you can add the zen theme as a submodule.

From the root of your site:

```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen.git themes/zen
```


## Updating

### Hugo module

From the root of your site:

```shell
hugo mod get -u github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen
```

### Git submodule

From the root of your site:

```shell
git submodule update --remote --merge
```


## Run example site

From the root of `themes/zen/exampleSite`:

```shell
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```


## Performance

Performance should be excellent.

* Minimal and compliant HTML5
* Styles 17,7 kB (4,3 kB when gzipped)
* JavaScript 8,4 kB (2,7 kB when gzipped)
* All scripts loaded in head with "defer"
* Optimised for HTTP/2

Some performance tools will complain about to many files (js and css files are not concatenated) but with HTTP/2 that can be ignored.

The site will work without setting any of the podcast parameters but your podcast feed will not be accepted by iTunes. At a minimum you need to set the first four, title, description, image and category name. Read more in the podcast section below.


## Customise


### Front page

This is a part that almost everyone will like to customise in some manner. The template file is `layouts/index.html`. By default it will include any text you put in `content/_index.md` and below that list the posts in "mainSections" as summaries.

If you do not specify any sections in the "mainSections" param (see configuration above) it will list the section with the most posts. If you do not want to list anything, set it but leave the value empty.


### Colours and variables

This is another part that almost everyone will like to customise.

They are found in the theme `assets/sass/_colors.scss` and `assets/sass/_variables.scss` files. Copy them to the root `assets/sass/` directory to set your own values.

If you only want to override a few variables copy the theme `assets/sass/_extra.scss` to the root `assets/sass/_extra.scss` and set the new values there. Anything in the extra file will override values in the variables file.

Examples of variables found in `assets/sass/_variables.scss`:

* $base-font-size: 18px;
* $max-content-width: 960px;
* $max-line-width: 70ch;


### Logo

Place your logo at `static/images/logo.png`. If you don't provide a logo, then the default theme logo will be used.


### Favicons

Upload your image to [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) then copy-paste the generated favicon files under `static`.

Then set the "realfavicongenerator" param to true to add the needed meta tags. Also good to set the "themeColor" param to correct colour.


### Layouts

To customise a layout included in the zen theme, copy it to the root layout directory and edit it there. Make sure to maintain the directory structure inside the layouts directory.

Add any new layouts to the root layout directory as well. This way they will not be overwritten when updating the theme.


#### Menu and sidebar layouts

If a Hugo main menu is defined (.Sites.Menu.main) the menu template will use it to build a navigation menu. If not, the template will automatically add entries for the home page, each root page and each section, in that order.

If the default sidebar is activated it will display each section with all its pages listed below.

They are set up in `layouts/partials/menu.html`, `layouts/partials/mobilmenu.html` and `layouts/partials/sidebar.html`.


### CSS grid for layout

Modern CSS grid is the easiest and cleanest way to layout your pages.

The CSS grid layout are in `assets/sass/layouts/_layouts.scss`. A lot can be done by just reordering "grid-template-rows".


### Other styles and scripts

Styles and scripts are processed with Hugo pipes that was added in Hugo 0.46.

To customise a js or sass file, copy it to the root assets directory and edit it there. Make sure to maintain the directory structure inside the assets/sass directory.

There is an `assets/sass/_custom.scss` file meant for your custom styles. Copy it to the root `assets/sass/_custom.scss` to use it.

The default styles in `assets/sass/_zen.scss` are boring but functional. You can easily override them completely by placing an empty file named "_zen.scss" in root assets/sass directory.

The sass files are by default built for production, compressed with fingerprint.

By setting the Hugo environment variable to "development" (default when running `hugo server`) they will instead be nested with sourcemaps.


## Render hook templates

### Add anchor links to headings

Example render hook template for headings that will add anchor links. To activate it copy the file `~/theme/zen/layouts/_default/_markup/render-heading.html.example` to `layouts/_default/_markup/render-heading.html`.

### Process Markdown images

Example render hook that process images in the same way as the "img" shortcode. See top of the file for settings to adjust it to your needs. To activate it copy the file `~/theme/zen/layouts/_default/_markup/render-image.html.example` to `layouts/_default/_markup/render-image.html`.

### Make external links open in a new tab.

Example render hook to rewrite external links so they open in a new tab. To activate it copy the file `~/theme/zen/layouts/_default/_markup/render-link.html.example` to `layouts/_default/_markup/render-link.html`.

## Multilingual

A language selector will be included on sites with more than one language. Add `languageName` to your language configuration, this is what will be displayed in the selector.

The language selector will link to a translation of the current page if it exist and to the front page if it does not.

For "rtl" languages add a `languageDirection` parameter to the language configuration. If not added it will default to "ltr".

Add a `languageCode` parameter to each language as well, that is used to set the correct language attribute in the `html` tag and in feeds. The root `languageCode` is then not needed. If not set the language key (e.g. "en") will be used.

```yaml
languages:
  sv:
    weight: 1
    languageName: "Svenska"
    languageCode: "sv-SE"
  en:
    weight: 2
    languageName: "English"
    languageCode: "en-GB"
  ar:
    weight: 3
    languageName: "العربية"
    languageDirection: "rtl"
    languageCode: "ar"
```

The Zen theme templates has some strings that needs translation, e.g. "Home" and "Menu". Many translations are included and you can easily add more to the `i18n` site directory. All but English and Swedish are contributed by users, thanks!

* Arabic
* Danish
* English
* Finnish
* French
* German
* Hebrew
* Indonesian
* Norwegian
* Portuguese
* Serbian
* Swahili
* Swedish


### Non English site

If you want to have a site in another language than English but do not need multiple languages the following settings are needed.

Set `defaultContentLanguage` to your language code, otherwise it will default to "en" . Also set `languageCode` so browsers are informed of what language the site is in.

Here how it looks for a site in Swedish.

```yaml
languageCode: "sv-SE"
defaultContentLanguage: "sv"
```


## Search

Built in integration with the excellent [FlexSearch.js](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch). A fast full text search that reads a JSON file created by Hugo to index and search the site.

Here is the three steps needed to create a search page.

1. Add a new output format in your configuration file.
    ```yaml
    outputFormats:
      SearchIndex:
        mediaType: "application/json"
        baseName: "searchindex"
        isPlainText: true
        notAlternative: true
    ```
2. Add the new output format to output setting for "home".
    ```yaml
    outputs:
      home: ["HTML", "SearchIndex", "[other formats you need]"]
    ```
3. Add the shortcode `{{< search >}}` to a page. The search and flexsearch js files gets loaded automatically on pages that use the shortcode.

Your search page will now have a search field where all the posts of the site can be searched.

The only setting is "searchLimit" that defaults to 20.


## Contact form

If your server support php with the mail() command (very common) you can use the included contact form feature to get a contact form for your site.

1. Copy the file `themes/zen/php/contact.php.example` to `static/php/contact.php`.
2. Edit the contact.php file so it has your own e-mail address. You may also change the mail subject prefix.
3. Add the shortcode `{{< contact >}}` to a page. The contact.js file gets loaded automatically on pages that use the shortcode.

If you have a SPF record for your domain, make sure the web server is listed or other mail server may mark the mail as spam.

Two types of spam protection are implemented. The form can only be posted after the user moved the mouse or pressed the tab or enter key. The form has a "honeypot" field that is invisible to humans but not to most spam boots. If that field is filled in the mail will not be sent.

Form validation is handled by HTML5 and there is some CSS to make it look nice.

Javascript is used for spam protection and to display error/success messages.

## Cookie consent

Allow users to opt-in to tracking. Matomo and Google analytic are supported out of the box.

See `assets/js/tracking.js` for example how to implement it.

The name of the cookie set is "cookieconsent" and it can have the values "accept" or "decline" depending on what button the visitor clicks.

![Lighthouse report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen/main/images/cookieconsent.png)


## Dates

If "lastmod" is set in the frontmatter on a post that value will be used in the "submitted" section. If not, "date" is used.

With "lastmod" set a date section will also appear at the bottom of post telling the reader the created and modification dates.


## Podcast

The Zen theme supports podcasting.

* RSS feed with all the needed iTunes tags.
* Single and full layouts with HTML 5 audio player.
* Archetype with required parameters.

Here follow all the possible podcast frontmatter parameters. Only the first two is mandatory and are in the podcast archetype.

```yaml
podcast:
    mp3:                    # * The path to the mp3 file, 
    duration:               # * Episode duration, e.g 1:04:02 (iTunes).
    image:
        src:                # Episode image src, place inside the assets directory (iTunes).
        alt:                # Alt text for the image, explain what is on the image.
        width:              # Image width in the article, defaults to 250px.
        class:              # Image wrapper class.
    explicit: true/false    # Episode explicit setting, default to false (iTunes).
    episode:                # Episode number (iTunes).
    episodeType: full/trailer/bonus # Episode type, defaults to full (iTunes).
    season:                 # Episode season (iTunes).
    block:                  # Block the episode from iTunes, default to no (iTunes).

This will produce:

```html
<div class="class-name-you-want">
<p>The <strong>content</strong> that should be wrapped.</p>

<p>Some more content.</p>
</div>
```

If the content should be left untouched add "nomarkdown" after the class name.

```
{{< wrapper class-name-you-want nomarkdown >}}
The **content** that should be wrapped.

Some more content.
{{< /wrapper >}}
```

This will produce:

```html
<div class="class-name-you-want">
The **content** that should be wrapped. Some more content.
</div>
```


## Content security policy headers

Includes tracking code for Matomo or Google in a way that supports Content security policy headers. Read more in my blog post [Content security policy headers when using Matomo or Google analytics](https://xdeb.org/post/2020/01/14/content-security-policy-headers-when-using-matomo-or-google-analytics/).

## Choose between using AlpineJS, jQuery or Umbrella JS

To add AlpineJS, jQuery or Umbrella JS, set the related parameter to true in the configuration file or in the front matter of specific pages. No problem having them loaded on the same page.

Personally I use vanilla JS nowadays and I'm playing around with AlpineJS.

This is the way I construct my JavaScript files.

**Vanilla JS:**

```js
(function () {

  'use strict';

  // Add a js class to the html-tag when JavsScript is active.
  document.querySelector('html').classList.replace('nojs', 'js');

})();
```


**Umbrella JS:**

```js
(function ($) {

  'use strict';

  // Add your code here.
  $('html').removeClass('nojs').addClass('js');

})(u);
```

**jQuery:**

```js
(function ($) {

  'use strict';

  // Add your code here.
  $('html').removeClass('nojs').addClass('js');

})(jQuery);
```


## Use npm to lint Sass and JavaScript

* Lint your Sass using stylelint.
* Lint your JavaScript using eslint.
* Can lint files in the theme as well as the project assets directory.

Set up your front-end development build tools:

1. Install Node.js and npm, the Node.js package manager.
2. The package.json file in your new sub-theme contains the versions of all the
Node.js software you need. To install them run:

        npm install

3. Run the following commands to lint your theme and projects Sass and JavaScript code.

        npm run lint-theme
        npm run lint-project
        nmp run lint (project + theme)


## Math typesetting with KaTeX

Download the latest release from <https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases>. Unpack and place the resulting "katex" directory in the root `static` directory.

The resulting path should be `static/katex`. Then set the `math` param to "true" and write some math to be typeset.

Wrap inline math in single "$":

~~~~
Lorem $E=mc^2$ ipsum
~~~~

and block math in double "$$":

~~~~
$$
[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} ]
$$
~~~~

Markdown rendering will in some instances mess with the math. To avoid this use the math shortcode for inline math:

~~~~
Lorem {{< math >}}E=mc^2{{< /math >}} ipsum
~~~~

 and math codeblocks for block math:

`~~~~ math`  
`[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} ]`  
`~~~~`
